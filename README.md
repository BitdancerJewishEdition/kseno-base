## What is this?
This is an external exec base made for learning but feel free to skid it, it works by overwriting VRNavigation bytecode then making Roblox run that overwritten bytecode

## How to build?
Install blake3, xxhash and zstd with vcpkg and open the project in Visual Studio and build!

## Crashing?
Make sure the offsets are up to date, if crashing persists update the LuaU library
